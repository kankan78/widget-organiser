2. Check for Amazon products:

- Extract ASIN codes (10-character Amazon identifiers).

- Extract any tabular data containing Title, Price, and Offers.

3. Skip irrelevant emails: If no ASINs are found, do not respond.

4. Build affiliate links: For each ASIN, create the URL in this exact format:
https://www.amazon.in/dp/<ASIN>?tag=apnabazaar_tgch-21

5. Pre-process product details Format Telegram message in plain text only (no Markdown/HTML):

- Identify and escape all unsafe characters before sending to Telegram.

- Unsafe characters: _ * [ ] ( ) ~ <> # + - = | { } . !`

- Escape rule: Prefix each unsafe character with a backslash (\).

- Example: 50% off (Limited) → 50\% off \(Limited\)
